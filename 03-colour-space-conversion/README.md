# Algorithms Challenge 3 - Colour Space Conversion

Write a program that converts a 24-bit colour BMP file to a 24-bit grayscale BMP file. Your program should handle IO, the pixel array's extraction 
and its subsequent conversion to one that would result in a perceptually 24-bit grayscale BMP file. You may not use any external dependencies 
other than the built-in standard library. It would be in your best interests to do some research on binary file IO, bitwise operations in your language, the BMP
file format specification, what the "24-bit" in the description means for the data you will process and colour space conversion algorithms. 
You may consider any one of the three algorithms  described by 
[John D. Cook](https://web.archive.org/web/20210930085419/https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/08/24/algorithms-convert-color-grayscale/).
