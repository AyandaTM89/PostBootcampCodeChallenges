# Code Challenges

## Introduction

Welcome to the first Independent Learning task in your post-bootcamp journey! Now that you are a HyperionDev Graduate, 
itâ€™s time to take the training wheels off! The Independent Learning module is designed to get you to practise learning 
how to solve problems without the help of a mentor or lecturer. A lot of research will be expected.

In this first task, you will need to tackle all five of these coding challenges. 
These challenges will be reviewed by one of your peers, and you will need to review at least five tasks from other graduates. 
This will help to reinforce your learning and expose you to other possible methods of solving the problem you may not have thought of.

The code challenges might be challenging but if you commit yourself, you will have a lot of fun - which is the most important
aspect of independent learning. Perfection is not the goal. It's the effort and fun that count.

### Outcomes

By the end of these code challenges, you should be able to:

- Parsing psuedocode that is different from any language you're familiar with.
- Confidently tackle unfamiliar problems and get yourself unstuck.
- Learn new techniques and ideas without the help of a mentor or lecturer.
- Conduct peer reviews.
- Have fun programming.

### Completion Requirements

- Complete all five code challenges. Your best effort is sufficient.
- Discuss the space and time complexity of your solution in each submission. Both space and time complexity are required.
Your justification here is important.
- Have your code challenge submissions peer reviewed based on completeness, efficiency, style and documentation. Make the necessary adjustments
till your peer reviewer is content.
- Peer review five code challenges from other graduates based on completeness, efficiency, style and documentation. This means you'll
need to comment on each of these items. Please remember to be encouraging.

### Instructions

- Fork this repository so you can do your work on your own repository.
- Just a suggestion to use either Python or JavaScript since those will be the most familiar among your peers. If you use Java, it may affect whether
you'll be able to find a peer reviewer.
- Any useful resources, queries, discussions or questions that you have be done on the GitHub issues using the appropriate tag. The intention for the GitHub
issues on this repository is for them to act as a forum you can always refer back to later. We welcome any feedback on whichever tags you think might
be useful.
- Remember to offer yourself up to peer review. You will need five peer reviews, one for each challenge, to fulfil the requirements.

#### Challenge Submission

- Create a branch with the folder name you are adding your solution to.
- Place your solution in the appropriate existing folder. Please exclude all generated or compilation binaries. 
If you use Java, this means no .class files. If you use JavaScript, no node_modules, etc.
- Add your discussion on space time and complexity to the README file.
- Push your solution to the remote branch hosted by GitHub. Do not push to the main/master branch.
- Make a pull request (but do not merge) to your main-master branch.
- Create a new issue on this repositories' issues requesting a peer review using the peer-review-request tag.
- Add the peer offering the peer-review as a reviewer to your pull-request. Once you've received the review, made the necessary adjustments 
and they are approved, merge the branch to the main/master branch.
- Offer a peer-review using the tag peer-review-offer.
- Create a 5 minute video tutorial on the code challenge and link to it in your README file. You can use YouTube's unlisted feature if you wish
for your tutorials to not be searchable if you wish to keep the tutorial private. You can share it with the rest of the graduates on the issue for 
tutorials for the particularchallenge you would have completed.
- Have a coffee with a friend before the next code challenge.
