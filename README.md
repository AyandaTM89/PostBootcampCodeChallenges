# Code Challenges

This is a repository for code challenges that you can use for the preparation of your mock interviews with Career Services.
Completing these code challenges will help you tighten up your programming ahead of the mock interview.

Each code challenge is accessible in each folder. You are encouraged to share ideas and review each other's solutions.

You are more than welcome to sue any programming language of your choice.
